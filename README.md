# big-two
Originating in Hong Kong, Big Two is a strategic trick-taking card game that demands well-timed plays and tactical foresight. Players take turns playing valid cards or combinations (tricks) from their hands, aiming to be the first to empty their hand or to have the fewest cards when another player finishes.
